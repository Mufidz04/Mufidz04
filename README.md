## ‚öô Latest Projects
| Projects | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| [Build a Movie Recomender System](https://github.com/Mufidz04/Movie-Recomennder-System) | Predictive analysis model to forecast stunting risk in children based on maternal nutritional factors. Used advanced statistical techniques like univariate, bivariate, and multivariate analyses to explore relationships with stunting likelihood. Also, Implemented regression models (e.g., Linear, Random Forest, Support Vector, Gradient Boosting) |
| [Build a Predictive Analysis Stunting In Indonesia](https://github.com/Mufidz04/Stunting-Indonesia) | Predictive analysis model to forecast stunting risk in children based on maternal nutritional factors. Used advanced statistical techniques like univariate, bivariate, and multivariate analyses to explore relationships with stunting likelihood. Also, Implemented regression models (e.g., Linear, Random Forest, Support Vector, Gradient Boosting) |
| Face Recognition System (Soon Public) | Developed an innovative face recognition system capable of accurately identifying individuals from low-resolution images. The project utilized REAL-ESRGAN (Enhanced Super-Resolution Generative Adversarial Network) for image upscaling and the Light CNN architecture for facial feature extraction and recognition. |
| [Validin](https://github.com/Mufidz04/validin-ml) | Led the development of a streamlined and user-friendly KTP validation system, leveraging auto-capture technology and Cloud Vision OCR for seamless and accurate extraction of information from Indonesian National ID Cards. |
